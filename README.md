**WARNING: This is not a working project. The code is seperated into two versions due to snapshot 24w09a which caused partial rewrite. It's very messy and largely unfunctional.**

**Some textures were modified Minecraft Textures. Copyright on those textures belongs to Mojang.**

Big thanks to anyone who helped us on Minecraft Commands Discord, all of the tutorial-making people who shared their knowledge through Youtube - especially CloudWolf; Misode, MCStacker team and all of the devs of the amazing tools we used during development of this project.
